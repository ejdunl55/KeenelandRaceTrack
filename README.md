A MapBox containing contuors ranging from 910' to 960'. Not quite as much terrain undulation as the Gorge.

![Keeneland Slideshow](Cesium%20Map.jpg)

Here is a slideshow I prepared featuring some interesting experiences I have had at Keeneland. Some history I have had at the course, as well as a point cloud of the running course.

# 2. Area of Choice

My area of choice is the famous Keeneland Race Track in Lexington, KY, just outside downtown. Opened since 1936, it is one of the most famous race tracks in the country, and a special place in the city to me. Some of these maps will have info on how special it is.
